- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xenomojin. I was born in and live in Germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in App/Game development and especially enjoy deep learning, multiplayer or beautiful algoriythms/simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust combined with Bevy. Unlike any other language I've tried (Java, C# and C),
Rust seems to combine every positive aspect of a low and hight level language I could imagine.
- 🐧 Fedora user here. I love the concept of Open-Source and community projects in general, but particularly Linux.
