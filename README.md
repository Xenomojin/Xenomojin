- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xenomojin. I was born in and live in Germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in app/game development and especially enjoy deep learning, networking or beautiful algoriythms/simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust combined with the bevy engine. Unlike any other language I've tried (java, javascript, C# and C),
rust seems to combine every positive aspect of a low and hight level language I could imagine.
- 🐧 Fedora user here. I love the concept of open-source and community projects in general, but particularly linux.
